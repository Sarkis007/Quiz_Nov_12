There are 6 functions in class Queue:
is_empty - returns True if the list is empty and vice versa - Complexity is O(1) because it only checks if the front is empty or not
EnQueue - adds data to the list - complexity is O(1) because it just adds data at the end
DnQueue - deletes data - complexity is O(1) because it just deletes the rear data
userEnqueue and userDequeue - user chooses to add data and to delete the first data added if there is one
display - diplays the data saved in the list complexity is O(n), where n is the quantity of the data in the list
